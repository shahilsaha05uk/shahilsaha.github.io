										<p class="project-description">
											Bounce Back is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game and was developed on Unity. This project is inspired from the Bounce game on the old Nokia phones. I have tried to extend this game and added some new features to make it engaging for a player. Some of the main features and mechanics includes a shop system which offers a few powerups for the player to use against the enemies to attack or defend themselves, some differen types of enemies which can now attack on sight and some additional levels as well. I had a wonderful time and the one thing that make this project different. By the time I started with my 2nd semester project, I was very comfortable with the engine and decided to try out and implement some of the other features provided by the Engine for my game and Some of them includes the new Input system and the 2D toolset. I did face a few hurdles although it was very little compared to what I had in my first semester. Overall, it was a great learning experience and I loved it.

										<p class="project-description">
											I took part in the Rising Star Games Development challenge where we were given the incomplete code for Minesweeper and were asked to show our creativity and add additional features to the project without changing the existing code.
										</p>
										<p class="project-description">
											For this project I started with working on making the complete the game like the original Minesweeper game by adding fdeatures like: the flagging system, Highlighting the neighbouring boxes and adding mines after the first move. Then I went on to add some additional features like adding the basic UI which includes a Pause, Settings and the Main Menu.
										</p>
										<p class="project-description">
											To make it more engaging to the players, I also added difficulty levels to the game. In addition, I also added a Challenger Mode to the game where the player needs to clear the board without detonating a single mine within a time limit. I also added a shop system where the player can buy some extra time and also discover a mine using the coins generated when they make a correct move.
											Although it was a confusing start since it was my first time I took part in such an event which is why it took quite some time to understand what was expected out of the final product. But Overall, I am happy with the product since I got to learn something new including the engine and also got to engage with the people who were a part of Grad In Games.

Throughout the time I learned how to write proper codes and make proper use of the different types of programming techniques. The most exciting part of this whole project for me was to create the AI for the enemies which at the start I found it to be pretty hard since I had no idea how to implement the logic but as I started doing some maths work behind the logic the more interesting it kept becoming. Overall I enjoyed the semester.

										</p>
										<p class="project-description">
											This was done over 3 months and by the end of the project I gained an in-depth knowledge o C++ and some brilliant game programming skills like reading from files like reading OBJ files into the scene other than the basic txt files.
